The files I studied while learning PHP consist of several PHP folders and files. They also contain various fundamental information about PHP, such as data types, conditional statements, functions, classes, modules, and much more.

  <summary><b>Installing PHP</b></summary>

  1. **Installing PHP on Linux**
     - Open the terminal.
     - Use the following commands to install PHP and Apache (if not already installed):
       ```sh
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install php apache2
       ```
     - Verify the PHP installation with the command:
       ```sh
       php -v
       ```
  2. **Installing PHP Using XAMPP**
     - Download and install XAMPP according to your Windows operating system.
     - Run the "XAMPP Control Panel" application.
     - Click the "Start" button next to the Apache and MySQL modules.
     - Open a web browser and go to the http://localhost address to confirm a successful XAMPP installation.
     - To access PHPMyAdmin, visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
  3. **Adding XAMPP to your PATH**
     - Open the Terminal:
     - Edit the .bashrc (or .zshrc) File:
       - To edit the .bashrc file (or .zshrc if you're using Zsh), use the nano text editor or any other text editor you prefer. For example, to edit the .bashrc file, use the following command:
       ```sh
       nano ~/.bashrc
       ```
     - Add XAMPP to Your PATH:
       - Within the .bashrc file, add the following line to append the XAMPP bin directory to your PATH. Replace /opt/lampp with the installation path of your XAMPP if it's different:
       ```sh
       export PATH="/opt/lampp/bin:$PATH"
       ```
     - Save and Exit:
       - Press Ctrl+O to save the changes, and then press Enter. Next, press Ctrl+X to exit the text editor.
     - Reload Your Shell Profile:
       - To activate the changes you made, run the following command:
       ```sh
       source ~/.bashrc
       ```
       - If you're using Zsh, replace .bashrc with .zshrc in the command above.
     - Check PHP Version:
       - Now, you can verify whether XAMPP and PHP are accessible from the Linux terminal by running the following command:
       ```sh
       php --version
       ```
  4. **Start XAMPP in localhost**
     - Launch XAMPP with the following command (ensure you have superuser permissions):
       ```sh
       sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
       ```
     - Run the XAMPP Control Panel with the command:
       - example
       ```sh
       sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run
       ```
     - Stop XAMPP with the following command:
       ```sh
       sudo /opt/lampp/lamp stop
       ```
